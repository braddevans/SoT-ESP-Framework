# SoT Hack (Based on Doug's Framework)
Hello all! I'm doing this framework for learning purposes, I'm not selling anything. You can get ban for using any cheats!

## Installation
```
> git clone https://github.com/Flowseal/SoT-Hack.git
> cd SoT-Hack
> pip install -r -requirements.txt
> cd Hack
> python main.py
```

## Updating offsets
You can see the folder called "SoT-Python-Offset-Finder-main". It's the Doug's utility that will help you updating offsets. All what you need is to copy SDKs folder from original repository to this folder. Original repository: https://github.com/DougTheDruid/SoT-Python-Offset-Finder. After that you can just run offset_finder.py and your offsets.json file will be updated!

### Major differences

- FOV changer
- Better visuals
- Other features that won't be mentioned in this list
